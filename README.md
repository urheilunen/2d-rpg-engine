My first game project. 
Game is supposed to contain randomly generated dungeons, upgradable player's stats like
stength, health, mana etc and various monsters and other stuff. For the beginning the main point is to 
make the engine of the game.
If you accidentaly come across this game, be sure you have unpacked imgs.rar next to main.py
